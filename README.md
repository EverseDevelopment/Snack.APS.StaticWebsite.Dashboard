# Forge Dashboard

<h3 align="left">An <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk Forge</a> static app to render model's data using chart.js
<br/>

## Getting Started
This is a plain javascript static app so there is no need to compile. Access the app on the index.html

Be aware that for security purposes there is a file missing in public>>js>>variables>>Variables.js, that file is supposed to contain a URN, a URL to securely obtain a forge token and an apikey to access the URL.
